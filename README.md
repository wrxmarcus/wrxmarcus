- 👋 Hi, I’m @wrxmarcus
- 👀 I’m interested in ... mostly learning git. I'm know SVN very well.  Also, I want to download and play with the bitburner source and markdown (2022. past)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... javascript & git/github.  So far, not a fan of javascript :/
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... world peace, mushroom foraging, and partner dancing ;-)
- 📫 How to reach me ... let's talk about this later.
